# <p align="center"> How to create a Virtual Environment in Python? </p>
---

## Why Virtual Environements?
Imagine you’re working on multiple Python projects simultaneously, each requiring different versions of libraries or even Python itself. Without virtual environments, managing these dependencies can quickly become chaotic. Here’s where virtual environments come to the rescue:
1. **Isolation:** Virtual environments provide isolated environments for each project, ensuring that the dependencies for one project don’t interfere with those of another.
2. **Dependency Management:** They allow you to install, upgrade, or remove packages without affecting the global Python installation, making it easier to manage project-specific dependencies.
3. **Portability:** Virtual environments encapsulate all dependencies within a project folder, making it easy to share projects with others without worrying about conflicting dependencies.

## Creating a Virutal Environment
### 1. Install `virtualenv`:
```
python -m pip install virtualenv
```

### 2. Create the Virtual Environment:
```
python<version> -m venv <virtual-enviroment-name>
```
**For example:**
```
python -m venv env
```
### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment
* **On Unix or MacOS:**
```
source env/bin/activate
```
* **For Windows Users:**
```
.\env\Scripts\activate
```
### 4. Deactivating the Virtual Environment
```
deactivate
```

## General Python's Virtual Environment Commands
### 1. Check Installed Dependencies
To view all the packages installed within your virtual environment.
```
pip list
```
### 2. Export Installed Packages to a File:
You can export a list of all installed package along with their versions to requirements file.
```
pip freeze > requiremenets.txt
```
### 3. Install Dependencies from a File
If you have requirements file generated by `pip freeze`, you can install all the dependencies listed in it.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
