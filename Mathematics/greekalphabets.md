# <p align="center"> Greek letters used in mathematics, science, and engineering </p>
---

In mathematics, several Greek letters are frequently used to represent constants, variables, functions, and special symbols. Some of the most common include: 
π (pi): Represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter (approximately 3.14159).
α, β, γ, δ (alpha, beta, gamma, delta): Used as variables, especially for angles in geometry and trigonometry.
θ (theta): Commonly used to represent an angle, particularly in trigonometry and calculus.
λ (lambda): Often used to represent wavelength, especially in physics.
μ (mu): Used to denote the mean or average in statistics and probability.
σ (sigma): Represents the standard deviation in statistics.
ρ (rho): Used to represent correlation or density.
ω (omega): Represents angular velocity or frequency, especially in physics.
Δ (delta): Used to represent a difference or change.
Σ (sigma): A summation symbol, used in series and sequences.
ϵ, ε (epsilon): Used in calculus and analysis to represent a very small value.
ζ (zeta): Can be used in various contexts, including the Riemann zeta function.
η (eta): Used in physics for viscosity and other related quantities.
φ, ϕ (phi): Often used in geometry and to represent the golden ratio.
ψ (psi): Used in physics and mathematics to represent a wavefunction or function.
χ (chi): Used in statistics and probability.
Ξ (xi): Less common, but can be used in various contexts.
Ω (omega): Represents angular velocity or frequency, and can also be used as the impedance symbol in electrical engineering.
Γ (gamma): Used to represent the gamma function in calculus.
Λ (lambda): Capital form of lambda, often used for matrices and other mathematical objects.
Π (pi): Capital form of pi, used as a product symbol in mathematics.
