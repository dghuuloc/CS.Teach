## What is Statistics?
Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with **collecting**, **analyzing**, **interpreting**, **presenting**, and **organizing** data. It involves the study of methods for gathering, summarizing, and interpreting data to make informed decisions and draw meaningful conclusions.

### Types of Statistics
* **Descriptive Statistics** involves methods for summarizing and organizing data. It provides simple summaries about the sample and the measures. These summaries may include measures of central tendency (like mean, median, and mode), measures of variability (like range, variance, and standard deviation), and graphical representations (like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots).
* **Inferential Statistics**, on the other hand, goes a step further and allows us to make **predictions** or **inferences** about a population based on a sample of data taken from that population. It involves using data from a sample to draw conclusions about a population, making it possible to estimate population parameters, test hypotheses, and make predictions. Inferential statistics relies on probability theory to gauge the reliability of the inferences made.

## Population and Sample

## What is Data in Statistics?
Data is a collection of observations, it can be in the form of numbers, words, measurements, or statements.
### Types of Data
* **Qualitative Data:** This data is descriptive. For example - She is beautiful, He is tall, etc.
* **Quantitative Data:** This is numerical information. For example- A horse has four legs.

Types of Quantitative Data

    Discrete Data: It has a particular fixed value and can be counted.
    Continuous Data: It is not fixed but has a range of data and can be measured.
