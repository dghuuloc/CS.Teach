## Understanding Descriptive and Inferential Statistics
**Descriptive Statistics** involves methods for summarizing and organizing data. It provides simple summaries about the sample and the measures. These summaries may include measures of central tendency (like mean, median, and mode), measures of variability (like range, variance, and standard deviation), and graphical representations (like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots).

Descriptive statistics help us to understand the basic features of the data and to present it in a meaningful way.

**Inferential Statistics**, on the other hand, goes a step further and allows us to make **predictions** or **inferences** about a population based on a sample of data taken from that population. It involves using data from a sample to draw conclusions about a population, making it possible to estimate population parameters, test hypotheses, and make predictions. Inferential statistics relies on probability theory to gauge the reliability of the inferences made.
