## What is Machine Learning
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence focused on building systems that can learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. The primary aim is to develop algorithms that can recognize patterns and make decisions based on data inputs.

* Traditional programming **uses algorithms** to produce results from data:
```
Data + Algorithms = Results
```
* Machine learning **creates algorithms** from data and resutls:
```
Data + Result = Algorithms
```
