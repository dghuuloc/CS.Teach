## Building effective machine learning systems
### Data Preparation
* Data Cleaning: Handling missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies.
* Data Transformation: Scaling, normalization, and encoding data to prepare it for model training.

### Feature Engineering 
* Creating New Features: Combining existing features or creating new ones to improve model performance.
* Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features to use in the model. 

### Selection: 
* **Choosing the Right Algorithm:**
  Selecting the appropriate algorithm based on the problem and data characteristics.
* **Understanding Algorithm Trade-offs:**
  Considering computational cost, scalability, and interpretability when selecting an algorithm. 

### Training:
* Supervised Learning: Training models with labeled data to predict outputs. 
* Unsupervised Learning: Training models to discover patterns in unlabeled data. 
* Reinforcement Learning: Training agents to make decisions in an environment to maximize rewards. 

### Evaluation: 
* **Performance Metrics:**
Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC to assess the model's performance.
* **Overfitting and Underfitting:**
Understanding the concept of overfitting (model is too complex) and underfitting (model is too simple).
* **Cross-Validation:**
Evaluating the model's performance on unseen data to ensure it generalizes well.

### Optimization: 
* **Bias-Variance Trade-off:**
Finding the right balance between model complexity (variance) and its ability to make accurate predictions (bias).
* **Regularization:**
Using techniques to prevent overfitting by adding penalties to complex models.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
Adjusting the algorithm's settings (hyperparameters) to optimize its performance.
    
### Deployment:
* Making Predictions: Using the trained model to make predictions on new data. 
* Monitoring and Maintenance: Tracking model performance and updating it as needed.
