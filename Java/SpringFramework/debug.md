# <p align="center"> Debug Spring Boot Application</p>
---
Debugging a Spring Boot application can involve several techniques depending on the nature of the issue and the deployment environment. The main types of debugging are:

## IDE-based Debugging (Local Debugging):
* This is the most common method for development. You run your Spring Boot application directly from an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code.
* You can set breakpoints in your code, which pause execution at specific lines.
* The IDE's debugger allows you to inspect variables, step through code line by line, evaluate expressions, and analyze the call stack.

## Remote Debugging:
* This involves connecting a debugger from your local machine to a Spring Boot application running on a remote server (e.g., a test server, a cloud environment like OpenShift, or a Docker container).
* The remote application needs to be started with specific JVM arguments to enable remote debugging.
* You then configure your IDE to attach to the remote JVM process using a specified port.

## Logging and Monitoring:
* **Debug Logging:** Spring Boot provides robust logging capabilities. You can configure logging levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) to get more detailed output in your console or log files. This can be enabled via `application.properties` or `application.yml` (e.g., `logging.level.root=DEBUG`).
* **Spring Boot Actuator:** This provides production-ready features like monitoring and management endpoints. Endpoints like `/health`, `/info`, `/metrics`, and `/loggers` can provide valuable insights into the application's state and help diagnose issues without direct code debugging.
* **Distributed Tracing:** For microservices architectures, tools like OpenTelemetry can be used to trace requests across multiple services, helping to identify performance bottlenecks or failures in a distributed system.

## Advanced Debugging Techniques:
* **Thread Dump Analysis:** For issues related to concurrency or deadlocks, analyzing thread dumps can reveal the state of threads and identify blocking operations.
* **Heap Dump Analysis:** For memory-related issues, analyzing heap dumps can help identify memory leaks or excessive memory consumption.
* **Live Debugging Tools:** Tools like BTrace allow for dynamic instrumentation of running Java applications, enabling you to inject code or observe behavior without restarting the application.

## Debugging Cloud-Native Applications:
* **Kubernetes-specific tools:** Tools like Skaffold and Telepresence can assist in debugging Spring Boot applications deployed on Kubernetes by simplifying the local development and debugging experience with remote clusters.
* **Cloud-native debugging platforms:** Solutions like Rookout provide specialized debugging capabilities for applications running in cloud environments, often without requiring code changes or restarts.
