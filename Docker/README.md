## What is container?

To summarize, a container:

- is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the _DockerAPI_ or _CLI_.
- can be run on local machines, virtual machines or deployed to the cloud.
- is portable (can be run on any operating system)
- 

## What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source software that runs on Linux and Windows. With Docker, you can package your application and its dependencies together into __containers__. Docker allows you to separate your applications from your infrastructure.

The company started as a platform as a service that was built on LInux containers. to help make and manage the containers, they built an in-house tool that they nicknamed `"Docker"`.

## How Does Docker Works?

First, there's the _Docker CLI_, which is what you interact with in your terminal. The CLI sends commands to a _Docker daemon_. This can run locally or on a remote host. The daemon is responsible for managing containers and the images they're created from.

The final component is called the _container runtime_. The runtime invokes kernel features to actually launch containers.

- Docker Engine or Docker is the base engine installed on your host machine to build and run containers using Docker components and services.
- It uses a client-server architecture
- Docker Client and Server communicate using Rest API

### What happends here?

- Docker Client is a service which runs a command. The command is translated using REST API and is sent to the Docker Daemon (server)
- Then, Docker Daemon checks the client request and interacts with the operating system in order to create or manage containers.

### Components of Docker

<div align="center"><img src="./images/docker-components.png"/></div>

#### Docker client and Server

<div align="center"><img src="./images/docker-server.png"/></div>

- Docker Client is accessed from the terminal and a Docker Host runs the Docker Daemon and Registry
- A user and build Docker Images and run Docker Containers by passing commands from the Docker Client to Docker Server

#### Docker Image

- Docker Image is a template with instructions, which is used for creating Docker Containers
- A Docker image is built using a file called Docker File
- Docker image is stored in a Docker Hub or in a repository (like registry.hub.com)

#### Docker container

- Docker Container is a standalone, executable software package which includes applicaions and their dependencies
- Numerous Docker Containers run on the same infrastructure and share operating system (OS) with its other containers
- Here, each application runs in isolation

#### Docker Registry

- Docker Registry is an open source server-side service used for hosting and distributing images
- Docker alse has its own default registry called Docker Hub
- Here, images cna be stored in either public or private repositories
  - Public repositories can be used to host docker Images which can be used by everyone
  - Private repositories allows a user to store Docker images that he/she wants to keep private
  - In order to build a container, `pull`  command is used to get a Docker image from the Docker repository
- Pull and Push are the commands used by users in order to interact with a Docker Registry
```
docker pull <image>:<tag>:pulls and image from DTR
```

```
docker push <image>:<tag>:pushes and image from DTR
```
#### Docker Recap

<div align="center"><img src="./images/docker-recap.png"/></div>

- Docker File crates a Docker Image using the build command
- A Docker image contains all the project's code
- using Docker image, any user can run the code in order to create Docker Containers
- Once a Docker Image is built, it's uploaded in a registry or a Docker Hub
- From Docker Hub, User can get the Docker Image and build new containers

## How to Install Docker on Arch Linux?

## Working on Docker

### Getting Started

You can check that your installation is working by starting a simple container:

``` 
$ docker run hello-word
```

This will start a new container with the basic `hello-word` image. The image emits some output explaining how to use Docker. The container then exits, dropping you back to your terminal.

### Create Your Project

In order to create your first Docker application, I invite you to create a folder on your computer. It must contain the following two files:

- `_main.py_` file (python file that will contain the code to be executed).
- `_Dockerfile_` file (Docker file that will contain the necessary instructions to create the environment) 

```
.
├── Dockerfile
└── main.py
0 directories, 2 files
```

### Edit the Python file

``` py
print("docker is magic!")
```

### Edit the docker file

The first thing to fo whrn you want to create your Dockerfile is to ask yoursel what you want to do. 


``` Dockerfile
# A dockerfile must always start by importing the base image.
# We use the keyword 'FROM' to do that.
# In our example, we want import the python image.
# So we write 'python' for the image name and 'latest' for the version.
FROM python:latest

# In order to launch our python code, we must import it into our image.
# We use the keyword 'COPY' to do that.
# The first parameter 'main.py' is the name of the file on the host.
# The second parameter '/' is the path where to put the file on the image.
# Here we put the file at the image root folder.
COPY main.py /

# We need to define the command to launch when we are going to run the image.
# We use the keyword 'CMD' to do that.
# The following command will execute "python ./main.py".
CMD [ "python", "./main.py" ]
```

### Create the Docker image

Once your code is ready the Dockerfile is written, all you have to do is create your image to contain your application.

```
$ docker build -t python-test
```

The `-t` option allows you to define the name of your image.

### Run the Docker image

Once the image is created, your code is ready to be launched.

```
$ docker run python-test
```

You need to put the name of your image after `docker run`

## CLI references

Refer to the following topics for further documentation on all CLI commands used in this article:

- docker version
- docker run
- docker image
- docker container

## Useful commands for Docker

- List your images
``` 
$ docker image ls
```
- Delete a specific image
```
$ docker image rm [image name]
```
- Delete all existing images
```
$ docker image rm $(docker images -a -q)
```
- List all existing containers (running and not running)
```
$ docker ps -a
```
- Stop a specific container
```
$ docker stop [container name]
```
- Stop all running containers
```
$ docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
```
- Delete a specific container (only if stopped)
```
$ docker rm [container name]
```
- Delete all containers (only if stopped)
```
$ docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```
- Display logs of a container
```
$ docker logs [container name]
```
